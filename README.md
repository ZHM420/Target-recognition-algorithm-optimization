# Target recognition algorithm optimization
## Introduction
### The project is to design and optimize target recognition algorithms base on Bayesian theory. Three kinds of algorithms are implemented:
#### Maximum-likelihood Estimation (ML)
#### Bayesian Parameter Estimation (BPE) & MAP 
#### Expectation Maximization (EM)
